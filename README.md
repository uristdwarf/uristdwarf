### About me

I'm @uristdwarf (points if you get the reference), also known as Urmas Rist. I'm currently studying Software development at Kood/Jõhvi. My main interests are
usually the low level stuff, i.e system programming and such. I am also interested in cybersecurity and attend my local CTF's.

### Kood/Jõhvi work

Since almost all of the work there is collaborative, I can't put most of the projects in my public repositories. When I get the time, I'll upload the individual
works that I alone created. If any potential employer wants to see those collaborative works (which, again, amounts to 90% of all projects), they'll have to
get in touch with me.
